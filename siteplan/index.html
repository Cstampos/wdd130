<p>To who this may concern(Brother Willden and Ami)</p>
<img src="images/logoA.JPG" alt="Logo">
<p>I believe I deserve an A on this assignment purely based on the fact that writing persuasive paragraphs about why I deserve an A—despite having done absolutely nothing to earn it—is, in itself, a masterclass in creativity, persuasion, and sheer audacity. Think about it: I’m basically doing rhetorical gymnastics here. I may not have studied the material, attended class, or, you know, learned anything, but look at me now—stringing together words like a caffeinated Shakespeare trying to charm his way out of a late fee. If that’s not A-worthy performance, I don’t know what is.</p>
