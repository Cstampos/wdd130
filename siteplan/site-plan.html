      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To present a well-structured, highly persuasive, and slightly humorous argument as to why I should receive an A in this course. Spoiler: It’s because of my impeccable HTML skills and sheer willpower.</p>
      
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The esteemed Brother Willdin and/or most gracious TA Amy grading this, classmates who may be inspired, and future generations who will look upon this project with awe for all eternity.</p>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>Welcome to my persuasive argument page as to why my A is inevitable.</p> 
      <p>Although I acknowledge that I stopped attending class midway through the semester and didn’t study as I should have, I still believe I deserve an A because of my potential and willingness to take responsibility for my actions. I’ve reflected on the choices I made and how they affected my performance, and I’ve realized the importance of accountability and discipline. Even though I didn’t fully engage this time, I’ve gained a better understanding of what it takes to succeed, which is a valuable lesson in itself.</p>

      <h3>Please</h3>
      <p>Brother Willden, I hope you and Ami can consider not just what I did, but what I’m capable of. I know this isn’t the most traditional argument for an A, but I believe that growth, self-awareness, and honesty should count for something. This experience, while imperfect, has motivated me to do better in the future and not take opportunities like this for granted. I know I could have succeeded in this class had I applied myself, and I plan to carry that lesson into every class moving forward.</p>
      <p>Lastly, while my actions didn’t reflect it, I do respect the time, effort, and energy that both you and Ami put into teaching. I regret missing out on more of it. If there’s any way I can make up for my lack of participation, I’m open to it. I understand that an A is a high grade, but I also believe this experience has pushed me to grow in ways that grades don’t always capture. I’m not just asking for a grade—I’m asking for a chance to learn from this and keep pushing myself forward.</p>
      <p>This page is a simple yet powerful expression of my request for an A.</p>
