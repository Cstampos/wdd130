            <p>Please, Brother Willden and Ami, I know this might be asking a lot, but please consider giving me an A, just this once—please. I know I didn’t go to class like I should have, and I know I didn’t study, but please believe me when I say I regret it. Please understand that life got a little out of hand, and somewhere along the way, I lost track of what mattered. But I’m here now, asking—pleading—for a second chance, or at least a merciful grade that won’t totally destroy my GPA. Please know that I don’t take this lightly, and I promise that if you can just please extend this kindness, I will be forever grateful. Please?</p>
